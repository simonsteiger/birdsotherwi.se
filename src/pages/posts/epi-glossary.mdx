    This is a glossary of rheumatology and epidemiology terms and definitions that I often forget. This list is always growing and never finished, with the small caveat that I'll certainly forget about it eventually. üåöüåù

## D

### Disease-modifying antirheumatic drug
&rarr; DMARD

<IndentedAside title="Conventional synthetic DMARD">
&rarr; csDMARD

csDMARDs are the "traditional" drugs used to treat RA, such as methotrexate (&rarr; MTX), sulfasalazine, leflunomide, hydroxychloroquine, and gold salts.
</IndentedAside>

<IndentedAside title="Biologic DMARD">
&rarr; bDMARD

bDMARDs are engineered proteins targeting specific inflammatory pathways, blocking cytokines, immune cells, or other receptors that play a key role in autoimmunity.
Examples are tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors (&rarr; TNFi) and interleukin (&rarr; IL) inhibitors.
</IndentedAside>

<IndentedAside title="Targeted synthetic DMARD">
&rarr; tsDMARD

tsDMARDs are are drugs developed to target specific molecular structures, such as Janus kinase inhibitors (&rarr; JAKi), e.g., baricitinib and tofacitinib.
</IndentedAside>

## P

### Prevention
The WHO defines prevention as "approaches and activities aimed at reducing the likelihood that a disease or disorder will affect an individual, interrupting or slowing the progress of the disorder or reducing disability".

<IndentedAside title="Primordial prevention">
Primordial prevention targets exposures of population risk factors before they can put anyone at risk.
</IndentedAside>

<IndentedAside title="Primary prevention">
Primary prevention targets the first apparent clinical manifestation of the preventable outcome (e.g., a vaccination for a disease).
</IndentedAside>

<IndentedAside title="Secondary prevention">
Secondary prevention aims at detecting a preventable outcome during a period in which it has not yet inflicted cricial and permanent damage.
</IndentedAside>

<IndentedAside title="Tertiary prevention">
Tertiary prevention aims at reducing the impact of a preventable outcome that already affects an individual negatively.
</IndentedAside>

<IndentedAside title="Quaternary prevention">
Quaternary prevention aims to reduce overmedicalisation by identifying those individuals not or no longer in need of treatment.
</IndentedAside>

## R

### Rheumatoid arthritis
&rarr; RA

Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects the joints. 
Rheumatoid arthritis is commonly abbreviated RA.
<IndentedAside title="Difficult-to-treat RA">
&rarr; D2T-RA

D2T-RA describes RA which has been unsuccessfully treated with at least two different mechanism of action b/tsDMARDs and shows signs of active or progressive disease.
Progressive disease is not limited to inflammatory joint pathology but captures a wider picture contributing to treatment failure, such as comorbidity, obesity, and fibromyalgia.

More specifically, the EULAR defintion comprises three elements: 
- history of failed treatments
- features of active disease
- the perception of challenging RA by the clinician and / or patient
</IndentedAside>

## T

### Treat to target strategy
&rarr; T2T

T2T aims to reduce disease activity to a specific target rather than treating symptoms as they arise.
The treatment target is typically DAS28 remission, or low disease activity (&rarr; LDA) if remission is not a realistic goal.
