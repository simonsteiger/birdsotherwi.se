## C

### Composite disease activity scores

Composite disease activity scores are mathematical devices that integrate several component scores into a single value.
The purpose of this integration is for both the patient and clinician to better be able to track the progression of the disease.

<IndentedAside title="Disease Activity Score, 28 joints">
&rarr; DAS28

The DAS28 is the most used composite score in RA.

There are two versions which differ in the acute phase reactants used: DAS28CRP and DAS28ESR.
The remaining components are identical: 28 tender joint count (&rarr; TJC28), 28 swollen joint count (&rarr; SJC28), and patient-rated global health (&rarr; PGH, 0-100 mm visual analogue scale).

The disease activity score calculation differs depending on which acute phase reactant was used:

```math
\begin{aligned}
\text{DAS28ESR} &= 0.56 \sqrt{\text{TJC28}} + 0.28 \sqrt{\text{SJC28}} + 0.70 \text{ln}(\text{ESR}) + 0.014 \text{PGH} \\
\text{DAS28CRP} &= 0.56 \sqrt{\text{TJC28}} + 0.28 \sqrt{\text{SJC28}} + 0.36 \text{ln}(\text{CRP + 1}) + 0.014 \text{PGH} \\
\end{aligned}
```
</IndentedAside>

<IndentedAside title="Clinical Disease Activity Index">
&rarr; CDAI

The CDAI does not require an acute phase reactant and can therefore be calculated right away when the patient visits the clinic.

The component scores are TJC28, SJC28, PGH, and evaluator-rated global health (&rarr; EGH, 0-10 cm visual analogue scale).

To calculate the CDAI score, the clinician simply adds up the component scores.
</IndentedAside>

<IndentedAside title="Simplified Disease Activity Index">
&rarr; SDAI

The component scores are TJC28, SJC28, CRP, PGH, and EGH (0-10 cm).

To calculate the SDAI score, the clinician simply adds up the component scores.
</IndentedAside>

<IndentedAside title="Cutoffs">
It is common practise to apply cutoffs to composite scores and assign discrete disease states to the resulting categories.

The cutoffs below are those for the most common composite scores used in RA.

| Disease activity | DAS28ESR | DAS28CRP | SDAI   | CDAI   |
|:-----------------|----------|----------|--------|--------|
| Remission        | < 2.6    | < 2.4    | ‚â§ 3.3  | ‚â§ 2.8  |
| Low              | ‚â§ 3.2    | ‚â§ 2.9    | ‚â§ 11.0 | ‚â§ 10.0 |
| Moderate         | ‚â§ 5.1    | ‚â§ 4.6    | ‚â§ 26.0 | ‚â§ 22.0 |
| High             | > 5.1    | > 4.6    | > 26.0 | > 22.0 |
</IndentedAside>

## D

### Disease-modifying antirheumatic drug
&rarr; DMARD

DMARDs are a category of otherwise unrelated disease-modifying drugs grouped due to their use in RA to slow down disease progression.
The term DMARD is often used separate these drugs from NSAIDs and steroids.

<IndentedAside title="Conventional synthetic DMARD">
&rarr; csDMARD

csDMARDs are the "traditional" drugs used to treat RA, such as methotrexate (&rarr; MTX), sulfasalazine, leflunomide, hydroxychloroquine, and gold salts.
</IndentedAside>

<IndentedAside title="Biologic DMARD">
&rarr; bDMARD

bDMARDs are engineered proteins targeting specific inflammatory pathways, blocking cytokines, immune cells, or other receptors that play a key role in autoimmunity.
Examples are tumor necrosis factor-alpha inhibitors (&rarr; TNFi) and interleukin (&rarr; IL) inhibitors.
</IndentedAside>

<IndentedAside title="Targeted synthetic DMARD">
&rarr; tsDMARD

tsDMARDs are are drugs developed to target specific molecular structures, such as Janus kinase inhibitors (&rarr; JAKi), e.g., baricitinib and tofacitinib.
</IndentedAside>

## N

### Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug
&rarr; NSAID

NSAIDs treat the inflammation present in, e.g., RA, but not its underlying cause.

## P

### Prevention
The WHO defines prevention as "approaches and activities aimed at reducing the likelihood that a disease or disorder will affect an individual, interrupting or slowing the progress of the disorder or reducing disability". <Citation citeKey="who_prevention_2025" citations={citations} />

<IndentedAside title="Primordial prevention">
Primordial prevention targets exposures of population risk factors before they can put anyone at risk.
</IndentedAside>

<IndentedAside title="Primary prevention">
Primary prevention targets the first apparent clinical manifestation of the preventable outcome (e.g., a vaccination for a disease).
</IndentedAside>

<IndentedAside title="Secondary prevention">
Secondary prevention aims at detecting a preventable outcome during a period in which it has not yet inflicted cricial and permanent damage.
</IndentedAside>

<IndentedAside title="Tertiary prevention">
Tertiary prevention aims at reducing the impact of a preventable outcome that already affects an individual negatively.
</IndentedAside>

<IndentedAside title="Quaternary prevention">
Quaternary prevention aims to reduce overmedicalisation by identifying those individuals not or no longer in need of treatment.
</IndentedAside>

## R

### Rheumatoid arthritis
&rarr; RA

Rheumatoid arthritis is a chronic autoimmune disease that affects the joints. 
Rheumatoid arthritis is commonly abbreviated RA.
<IndentedAside title="Difficult-to-treat RA">
&rarr; D2T-RA

D2T-RA describes RA which has been unsuccessfully treated with at least two different mechanism of action b/tsDMARDs and shows signs of active or progressive disease (for more details, see the EULAR definition of D2T-RA <Citation citeKey="nagy_eular_2021" citations={citations} />).
Progressive disease is not limited to inflammatory joint pathology but captures a wider picture contributing to treatment failure, such as comorbidity, obesity, and fibromyalgia.

More specifically, the EULAR defintion comprises three elements: 
- history of failed treatments
- features of active disease
- the perception of challenging RA by the clinician and / or patient

### Why at least *two* different mechanisms?
Two different mechanisms of action failing to control the RA disease reflects a drug-resistant disease state. <Citation citeKey="tan_difficult_2022" citations={citations} />
</IndentedAside>

## S

### Steroids

Steroids dampen the immune response in autoimmune diseases such as RA but cannot slow down the progression of the disease.

## T

### Treat to target strategy
&rarr; T2T

T2T aims to reduce disease activity to a specific target rather than treating symptoms as they arise.
The treatment target is typically DAS28 remission, or low disease activity (&rarr; LDA) if remission is not a realistic goal.
